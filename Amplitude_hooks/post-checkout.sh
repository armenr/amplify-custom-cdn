## Step Zero
## Checks to see if we've checked out to a newly-created branch & if we have, auto-commits an empty "first" commit
##
## Rationale: Due to the way Git maintains refs to hashes for HEAD (even when moving between branches of different names)
##            we need to first always add a default/empty commit on new branch checkout. It's also nice because it orients you.
##
## Don't believe me?

## Try this out: 1. Create an empty folder
##               2. git init
##               3. git checkout -b my_new_branch
##               4. git branch
##               5. Surprised? There is no output! That's because git isn't aware of the fact you're in a new branch
##                  as the HEAD ref isn't actually pointing at ANYTHING! :)

##            Caveat: We don't want this to happen in the case of "protected" branches:
##            ---->   staging/qa, production/prod, main/master, dev/development

## The post-merge hook runs after a successful merge command. You can use it to restore data in the working tree that
## Git canâ€™t track, ## such as permissions data. This hook can likewise validate the presence of files external to Git
## control that you may want copied in when the working tree changes.

# Git passes these to the hook as arguments, so we use them.
